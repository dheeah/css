                    for 6 years then I moved to a new high-school back then,
                    Esprit in which I spent 3 years. Finally I spent my last years right before university at ECT,
                    l'école canadienne de tunis, in which I got my baccalaureate degree.
                    However, later on, I spent 5 years in Massachusetts Institute of Technology studying several stuff
                    related to the high-tech used nowadays and other subjects such as coding.
                    All the info needed such as my marks will be provided right in the Marks category. </p>

                time, generally speaking my sports/esports career
                since the young age until now, it started when I was at the age of 6, it was when I started my first
                Taekwando class, in which I've spent 3 years. Then I spent
                Playing football till the age of 16, by then I started going to gym until now. Concerning esports, I've
                never been into a real esports team even tho, I did reach high ranks in some games
                such as League Of Legends. Overall, I played some other few games like Rainbow Six Siege, Valorant and
                CS:GO. </p>
